This is a work in progress.

Python Gossip servers to share server state

These are mostly based off of Cassandra's implementaiton
http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip
which is based on the paper
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf

Uses thrift for serialization and asynchronous server messaging.
You will need the thrift python libraries installed.
http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/

TODO:
Add more interactive client
 * Get/Return EndpointStates from server
Add State Listener for state changes.
Add Endpoint Listener for state changes
Maybe drop thrift dependency for something all python?
